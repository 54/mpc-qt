## Media Player Classic Qute Cinema

A clone of Media Player Classic reimplimented in Qt.

[Media Player Classic Home Cinema] is considered by many to be the
quintessential media player for the Windows desktop.  I would like mpc-qt to
reproduce most of the interface and functionality of mpc-hc while using
[libmpv] to play video instead of DirectShow.


## What works

Nothing. It's just a mock-up right now. Feel free to fork or do whatever you
want with it.
