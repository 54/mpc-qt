## Media Player Classic Qute Cinema

A clone of Media Player Classic reimplimented in Qt.

[Media Player Classic Home Cinema] is considered by many to be the
quintessential media player for the Windows desktop.  I would like mpc-qt to
reproduce most of the interface and functionality of mpc-hc while using
[libmpv] to play video instead of DirectShow.


## What works

You can play back files and control them from the ui.  The menu is largely
empty, however.
