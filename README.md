## Media Player Classic Qute Cinema

A clone of Media Player Classic reimplimented in Qt.

[Media Player Classic Home Cinema] is considered by many to be the
quintessential media player for the Windows desktop.  To encourage migration
away from the Windows desktop, mpc-qt intends to reproduce most of the
interface and functionality of mpc-hc while using [libmpv] to play video
instead of DirectShow.

That's said, you're probably better off using [bomi] or [baka] because they
are far more mature.  And I don't feel like I can faithfully invest the
required time for a ambitious project like this.


## What works

Nothing. It's just a mock-up. Feel free to fork.
